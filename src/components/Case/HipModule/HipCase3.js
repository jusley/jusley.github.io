He plays in an “old timer hockey league” a few days per week. He tells you that the pain started halfway through the season after a shift where he had a fast breakaway. It’s now nearing the end of the season, but the pain is getting worse and happening more frequently. Erik tells you that he’s worried about the pain since the playoffs are approaching and he’s the top scorer!"
