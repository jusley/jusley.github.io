message={<p>The most likely diagnosis is A, Medial Meniscus Tear. <br></br><br></br>

    <b>Clinical features:</b> There are two main types of meniscus tears, acute and degenerative. In Johnâ€™s case, given the acute onset of his symptoms, and a preceding event, we are more concerned of an acute etiology. In patients who are older with most insidious symptoms, a degenerative tear is likely suspected. It is important to note that in knees of patients &gt;50  years old with OA, surgery is no longer indicated in degenerative tears. 
    <br></br>Meniscal tears are more common in ACL deficient knees

                    The <b>McMurray test</b> is performed by flexing the patient's knee. To assess for medial meniscus, while palpating the joint line, the leg is externally rotated and extended. To assess for lateral meniscus, the leg is internally rotated and extended.

            C: An MRI is the goal standard test to diagnose meniscus pathology since its an intra-articular finding.

            <br></br>acute event with clear indications for meniscal injury in young patients, those with mechanical symptoms (catching, locking), and in those where an acute ligamentous injury (ACL/PCL) is also suspected

    John receives his MRI. On his report you note an oblique tear of his medial meniscus. His ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL are in tact. <br></br><br></br>

    John asks you how we should go about treating his medial meniscus tear.

    Despite trying conservative measures, John still reports catching, clicking, and continued swelling in his knee. He elects to pursue surgery. <br></br><br></br>

    After surgery, he completes gradually rehabilitation and is eventually able to return to his daily activities.
